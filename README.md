# VaccineSystem
This is the prpject that was developed and implemented to address the problems in Vaccine management generally consisting of a mess of siloed computer applications and paper-based systems that are managed by the CDC
and state-level vaccination programs. The task is to build a vaccine inventory management and distribution system that will operate at the national, state and local levels. The objective is to use application engineering technology to improve the efficiency, accountability, and the ability to respond to safety problems and public health crises.
